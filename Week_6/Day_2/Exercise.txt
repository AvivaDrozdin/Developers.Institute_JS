Exercise3.

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT
(
   DEPTCODE   INTEGER,
   DeptName   CHAR(30),
   LOCATION   VARCHAR(33)
);

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE
(
   EmpCode      INTEGER,
   EmpFName     VARCHAR(15),
   EmpLName     VARCHAR(15),
   Job          VARCHAR(45),
   Manager      CHAR(4),
   HireDate     DATE,
   Salary       INTEGER,
   Commission   INTEGER,
   DEPTCODE     INTEGER
);

STEPS:

I. Improve the tables

1. DEPTCODE is the PK of the Department table (incremented by 10)
the first deptcode is 10, the second dept code is 20 ect...
--> Look in the internet, how to create a sequence
2. EmpCode is the PK of the Employee table (not serial)
3. DEPTCODE is the FK of the Department table
4. Default salary is : 0 and is a decimal
5. Employee names cannot be null
6. Location department needs to be unique
