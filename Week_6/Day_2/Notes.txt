Lesson on Update, Delete
-- Alter table : 
-- * Add 2 more columns: 
-- salary (integer), 
-- nationality (varchar)

-- Creating a column named salary of type integer
-- ALTER TABLE actors ADD COLUMN salary integer;
-- ALTER TABLE actors ADD COLUMN nationality varchar(20);
-- Add several columns in one line
-- ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN col1 int, ADD COLUMN col2 int;

--Update
-- Salary of 100000 for actors that have more than 2 oscars

-- UPDATE actors
-- SET salary = 100000
-- WHERE
--     number_oscars > 2
-- RETURNING first_name, last_name;

-- Salary of 50000 for actors that have less than 2 oscars

-- UPDATE actors
-- SET salary = 50000
-- WHERE
-- 	number_oscars<=2
-- RETURNING *

-- Update the nb of oscar of Matt Damon to one more

-- UPDATE actors
-- SET number_oscars = number_oscars+1
-- WHERE first_name='Matt' AND last_name='Damon'
-- RETURNING *;

-- We are in Hollywood, add to all actors a nationality "American"

-- NO WHERE Clause

-- UPDATE actors
-- SET nationality = 'American'
-- RETURNING *

-- INSERT INTO actors (first_name, last_name, date_birth, number_oscars)
-- VALUES('Jennifer','Aniston','1970-10-08',0), ('Emma', 'Watson','1970-10-08',0)
-- RETURNING *

-- Change the salary proportionaly to their number of oscars, for the 2 first actors (IN clause)

-- UPDATE actors
-- SET salary = 100000*number_oscars
-- WHERE actor_id IN (1,2)
-- RETURNING *


-- --Delete
-- Delete Jennifer Aniston
-- WITHOUT THE "WHERE" you delete everything from the table


-- DELETE FROM actors
-- WHERE last_name='Aniston'
-- RETURNING *;


-- INSERT INTO actors (first_name, last_name, date_birth, number_oscars)
-- VALUES('test1','test1','1970-10-08',0);


-- DELETE FROM actors;
-- TRUNCATE TABLE actors RESTART IDENTITY; -- to restard the primary key 

-- SELECT * FROM actors ORDER BY actor_id ASC;









-- AVG() – return the average value.
-- COUNT() – return the number of values.
-- MAX() – return the maximum value.
-- MIN() – return the minimum value.
-- SUM() – return the sum of all or distinct values.

-- We often use the aggregate functions with the GROUP BY clause in the SELECT statement. 
-- In these cases, the GROUP BY clause divides the result set 
-- into groups of rows and the aggregate functions perform a calculation on each group e.g., 
-- maximum, minimum, average, etc.

-- Number of lines : 3 actors in the table
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actors
-- -- -- 2 actors have more than 2 oscars
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actors WHERE number_oscars > 2;

-- -- Max and Min
-- SELECT COUNT(*) AS nbActors, MAX(number_oscars) AS maxNbOscars, MIN(number_oscars) AS minNbOscars FROM actors;
-- SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actors WHERE number_oscars = (SELECT MAX(number_oscars) FROM actors);

-- --Average
-- SELECT AVG(number_oscars) FROM actors;
-- -- Need to Round it
-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(number_oscars)) FROM actors;

-- --Sum
-- SELECT SUM(number_oscars) FROM actors;


-- --Problem
-- -- ERROR:  column "actors.first_name" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
-- SELECT first_name, last_name, AVG(number_oscars) FROM actors;

-- -- Group By
-- -- The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows,
-- -- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) 
-- -- to group the result-set by one or more columns.
-- -- The queries that contain the GROUP BY clause are called grouped 
-- -- queries and only return a single row for every grouped item.

-- The average nb of oscars for the American actors
-- SELECT nationality, AVG(number_oscars) FROM actors GROUP BY nationality HAVING nationality = 'American';

-- The sum nb of oscars for the American actors
-- SELECT nationality, SUM(number_oscars) FROM actors GROUP BY nationality HAVING nationality = 'American';

-- The nb of actors that are Americans
-- SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) FROM actors GROUP BY nationality HAVING nationality = 'American';

-- How many actors have the first_name George
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actors WHERE first_name='George';

-- What are the unique first_names in the table
-- SELECT DISTINCT first_name FROM actors;



-- SELECT first_name, nationality, COUNT(*) FROM actors GROUP BY first_name, nationality;
-- SELECT first_name, nationality, COUNT(*) FROM actors GROUP BY nationality, first_name;

-- Restricting query results using the HAVING clause
-- It's not always that we will want to perform groupings on all 
-- the data in a given table. There will be times when we will want 
-- to restrict our results to a certain given criteria.  
-- In such cases , we can use the HAVING clause
-- SQL Having Clause is used to restrict the results returned by the GROUP BY clause.
-- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

-- SELECT column_name(s)
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE condition
-- GROUP BY column_name(s)
-- HAVING condition
-- ORDER BY column_name(s);

-- SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) FROM actors GROUP BY nationality HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
