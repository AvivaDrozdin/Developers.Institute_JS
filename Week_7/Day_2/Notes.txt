---------- Creating Server with Node.Js --------------

const http = require('http');   <------- Module build in to Node.Js

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    
    
    This method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body have been sent; that server should consider this message complete. The method, response.end(), MUST be called on each response.
     res.end('Hello from my first web server')
})   


server.listen(5000,()=> {
    console.log('Server is listening to port 5000');
})



----- IMPORTANT: When deploying: DELETE NODEMON!!!! Use Node -----------
